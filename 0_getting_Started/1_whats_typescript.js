// TypeScript is a programming language to address defects of JS
// TS is build on top of JS so every JS file is a valid TypeScript file.
// TS added some really useful features that help us build more robust and maintainable applications in less time
// Benefits:

//  - Static typing -->  We know the type of variables at compile time or while coding
//      For example we decalare a variable of type int
// *        lex x: number = 10; --> This variable can only hold int values.
//      If we declare a variable as a number we cannot set it to a string //// x = 'a'
//      In Dynamic typed langagues we can change the type of variables at runtime (JS is dynamic).
// !    TypeScript is essentially JS with Type Checking. With TS we explicitly set the type of variables upon declaration.

// Most code editors have great support for TS, so they can detect the type of variables and offer features to write cleaner and concise code:
//  - Code Completion
//  - Refactoring
//  - Shorthand notations

// These features get added to JS, but because runtime environments and various browsers for executing JS code it takes time
// until these features are implemented in various browsers.
// By coding in TS we can use the features of future JS.

// So TS is build intop of JS and we can use it whenever we use Js on Front or Back-end, everything we do in JS can be done with TS.

// The drawbacks of TS are:
//  -   Compilation --> Theres always a compilation step involved because browsers dont understand TS code.
//          So we have to give our code to a JS compiler, to compile and transfer into JS This prosses is callded // * Transpilation.
//  - Disipline in coding --> We have to be more careful when writing code.

// TypeScript is used in Medium to large projects.
// JavaScript is used in Simple projects.
